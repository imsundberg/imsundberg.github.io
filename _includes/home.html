	I am a third-year graduate student at Bryn Mawr College. My research interests are in low-dimensional topology. In the spring of 2018, I received my master's degree from Bryn Mawr. My thesis was an exposition on Stallings' Fibering Theorem, advised by <a href="http://www.brynmawr.edu/math/people/melvin/">Paul Melvin</a>. Currently, I am taking my preliminary examinations. I am also an active member of the Graduate Student Association (GSA) at Bryn Mawr, now serving as a co-chair.
