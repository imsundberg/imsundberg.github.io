	I am a PhD candidate and TA in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College. After two years of coursework, I passed my preliminary exams (fall 2018), and am now focused on my research in low-dimensional topology. During this time I also received my master's degree (spring 2018); my thesis was an exposition of Stallings' Fibering Theorem, advised by <a href="http://www.brynmawr.edu/math/people/melvin/">Paul Melvin</a>. 
	
	I love teaching, and it is why I pursued mathematics. As an undergraduate, I spent three years tutoring in the Murphy Learning Center, and throughout my graduate career, I have been a teaching assistant.
	
	On campus, I am also an active member of the Graduate Student Association (GSA) at Bryn Mawr; currently, I am a cochair.
