	<div id="contentPar">
	I am a third year graduate student at Bryn Mawr College (as of Fall 2018), researching low-dimensional topology with my advisor Paul Melvin. My research interests are currently in smooth 4-manifolds and Khovanov homology. For more info on my research, see my <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/research/index.html">Research</a> page.

	<div id="contentPar">
	I am also interested in teaching, which has been my passion since my days as an undergraduate math tutor. While at Bryn Mawr, I have been a TA for a variety of math courses and learned many (un)successful teaching strategies. This fall (2019), I will pursue the <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/gsas/deans-certificate-pedagogy">Dean's Certificate in Pedagogy</a> at Bryn Mawr.

	Another passion of mine is working with the Bryn Mawr community. I enjoy spending time on running/attending seminars in the math department, along with serving on the executive board of the Graduate Student Association (GSA). In particular, I have focused my energies on reflecting Bryn Mawr's <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/diversity-equity-and-inclusion">diversity, equity, and inclusion</a> framework in the GSA mission and active responsibilities.
