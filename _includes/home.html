  <div id="contentBlock">
    I am a third-year graduate student at Bryn Mawr College. My research interests are in low-dimentional topology. In the spring of 2018, I received my master's degree from Bryn Mawr; my thesis was an exposition on Stallings' Fibering Theorem. Currently, I am preparing for my preliminary examinations.
    <br>
    I am also an active member of the Graduate Student Association (GSA) at Bryn Mawr. Currently, I am a co-chair of the GSA.
