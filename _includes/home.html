  I am a third-year graduate student at Bryn Mawr College. My research interests are in low-dimentional topology. In the spring of 2018, I received my master's degree from Bryn Mawr; my thesis was an exposition on Stallings' Fibering Theorem (see <a href="https://isaacmc.github.io/research/index.html">Research</a>). Currently, I am preparing for my preliminary examinations.
