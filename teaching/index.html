	I love teaching! Bryn Mawr offers numerous ways for graduate students to become well-rounded educators. Currently, I am participating in numerous Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion seminars at Bryn Mawr, which focus on creating a more inclusive classroom environment. I am also pursuing the <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/gsas/deans-certificate-pedagogy">Dean's Certificate in Pedagogy</a> at Bryn Mawr; the resulting portfolio will be uploaded here.
