\section{Category Theory}

\subsection*{\underline{Categories}}

\begin{definition*}
	A \textbf{category} $\calC$ consists of: 
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12.5pt]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
		\item a class $\obj(\calC)$ of \textbf{objects}; 
		\item to each pair of objects $A, B$, a class $\hom(A, B)$ of \textbf{\textit{morphisms}}, denoted $f\: A \to B$;
		\item to each triple of objects $A, B, C$, a function $$\circ\: \hom(B, C) \times \hom(A, B) \to \hom(A, C)$$ defined by $(g, f) \mapsto g \circ f$ called the \textbf{\textit{composite}} of $f$ and $g$;
	\end{itemize}
	all subject to the associativity and identity axioms:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12.5pt]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
		\item for all morphisms $f\: A \to B$, $g\: B \to C$, $h\: C \to D$, we have $h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f$;
		\item for all objects $B$ in $\obj(\calC)$ there is a morphism $\1_B\: B \to B$ such that for any $f\: A \to B$ and $g\: B \to C$ we have $\1_B \circ f = f$ and $g \circ \1_B = g$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	A morphism $f\: A \to B$ is an \textbf{equivalence} if there is a morphism $g\: B \to A$ such that $g \circ f = \1_A$ and $f \circ g = \1_B$. The objects $A$ and $B$ are \textbf{equivalent}.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	An object $A$ in a category $\calC$ is \textbf{universally attracting} (resp. universally repelling) if for every object $B \in \obj(\calC)$ there is a unique morphism $B \to A$ (resp. $A \to B$).
\end{definition*}

\exc{State which type of morphisms are equivalences in each of the categories below.}
\exc{Show universally attracting (resp. repelling) elements are unique up to equivalence.}
\exc{Find the universally attracting and repelling objects in each of the categories below.}
\vskip10pt

\subsection*{Examples of Categories}
\vspace{-5pt}\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item The category $\Set$ whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions.
	\item The category $\Grp$, $\Rng$, or $\Mod_R$ whose objects are groups, rings, or $R$-modules and whose morphisms are group homomorphisms, ring homomorphisms, or $R$-linear maps.
	\item The category $\Top$ of topological spaces with continuous functions.
	\item The category $\hTop$ of topological spaces with continuous functions up to homotopy (note that the morphisms here are not functions, but equivalence classes of functions).
\end{itemize}

\clearpage %style

\subsection*{\underline{Products and Coproducts}}

\begin{definition*}
	Let $\calC$ be a category with $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ a family of objects. A \textbf{product} for the family is an object $P$ together with a family of morphisms $\{\pi_i\: P \to A_i\}_{i\in I}$ such that whenever $Q$ has a family of morphisms $\{\varpi_i\: Q \to A_i\}_{i \in I}$ there is a unique morphism $\varphi\: Q \to P$ such that $\pi_i \circ \varpi_i = \pi_i$ for each $i \in I$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
	& P \arrow[dl, "\pi_1"']\arrow[dr, "\pi_2"]& \\
	A_1 &  & A_2 \\
	& Q \arrow[ul, "\varpi_1"]\arrow[ur, "\varpi_2"']\arrow[uu, dashed, "\varphi"]  & \\
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Examples of (Co)Products}
\vspace{-5pt}\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item Let $\calC$ be the category whose objects are the bounded subsets of the $\R$ and whose morphisms are inclusions $A \hookrightarrow B$ for bounded subsets $A$ and $B$ of $\R$ with $A \subseteq B$. The intersection of countably many objects in $\calC$ forms a product in $\calC$; there are no coproducts in $\calC$.
	\item Let $\calD$ be the category whose objects are positive integers and whose morphisms $p \to q$ exist iff $p$ divides $q$. The greatest common divisor of countably many objects in $\calD$ forms a product in $\calD$; the least common multiple of countably many objects in $\calD$ forms a coproduct.
	\item Let $\mathcal{E}$ be the category whose objects are finite groups. It is easy to see that the product of finitely many objects in $\mathcal{E}$ exists in $\mathcal{E}$, however, the coproducts are not necessarily contained in $\mathcal{E}$. If we restrict $\mathcal{E}$ to finite abelian groups, the coproduct exists, and is equal to the product.
\end{itemize}
\vskip5pt

\exc{Show the (co)products in the above examples are indeed (co)products. If (co)products do not exist in the given category, then provide a counterexample.}
\exc{Write out the definition for \textbf{\textit{coproducts}} by switching all arrows in the definition for products. Draw a diagram similar to the one above.}
\exc{Show that (co)products are unique up to equivalence.}
\vskip20pt

\subsection*{\underline{Functors}}

\begin{definition*}
	A \textbf{covariant functor} $T$ between categories $\calC$ and $\calD$ is a pair of functions assigning each object $A \in \obj(\calC)$ an object $T(A) \in \obj(\calD)$ and each morphism $f\: A \to B$ in $\calC$ a morphism $T(f) \: T(A) \to T(B)$ in $\calD$ such that
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12.5pt]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
		\item $T(\1_A) = \1_{T(A)}$ for all objects $A$ in $\calC$;
		\item $T(g \circ f) = T(g) \circ T(f)$ for all morphisms $f, g$ in $\calC$ with $g \circ f$ defined.
	\end{itemize}
	By reversing all arrows, we obtain the definition for \textbf{contravariant functors}.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	A functor $T\: \calC \to \calD$ induces a function on the morphisms of $\calC$ and $\calD$, denoted \[ F_{XY}\: \Hom(X, Y) \to \Hom(F(X), F(Y)). \] If this map is injective, we say $F$ is \textbf{faithful}. If it is surjective, we say $F$ is \textbf{full}. A functor which is full and faithful is \textbf{fully faithful}.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	A \textbf{concrete category} is a category with a faithful functor to the Set category.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	Fix an object $A$ in a category $\calC$. Define $F_A\: \calC \to \Set$ by \[ F_A(C) = \hom(A, C), \hskip10pt F_A(f) \: \hom(A, B) \to \hom(A,C) \] where $F_A(g) = f \circ g$ for all $f\: B \to C$. This is called the \textbf{covariant hom functor}.
\end{definition*}

\clearpage %style

\subsection*{\underline{Natural Transformations}}

\begin{definition*}
	Given covariant functors $F$ and $G$ between categories $\calC$ and $\calD$, a \textbf{natural transformation} $\alpha$ from $F$ to $G$ is a family of morphisms $\{\alpha_C\: F(C) \to G(C)\}_{C \in \obj(\calC)}$ in the category $\calD$ making
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}[]
			F(C) \arrow[r, "\alpha_C"] \arrow[d, "F(f)"'] & G(C) \arrow[d, "G(f)"] \\
			F(D) \arrow[r, "\alpha_D"] & G(D)
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	commute for each $f \in \hom(C, D)$. If each $\alpha_C$ is an equivalence, we say $\alpha$ is a \textbf{natural equivalence}.
\end{definition*}
\vskip20pt

\subsection*{\underline{Free Objects}}

\begin{definition*}
	In a concrete category $\calC$, an object $X \in \obj(\calC)$ is \textbf{free} if there is a subset $B \subset X$ such that any function from $B$ to an object $Y \in \obj(\calC)$ extends uniquely to a morphism $X \to Y$.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = large]
			B \arrow[r, hook]\arrow[dr] & X \arrow[d, dashed, "\exists !"] \\
			 & Y 
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	The set $B$ is called a \textbf{basis} for $X$ in $\calC$. This extension property is called the \textbf{universal property} (succinctly, an object is free if it has a subset satisfying the universal property).
\end{definition*}
\vskip10pt %style

\subsection*{Examples of Free Objects}
\vspace{-5pt}\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item In the category of groups, the free objects are called free groups; we will construct them below.
	\item Restricting to abelian groups, the free objects are (up to isomorphism) direct products of $\Z$'s.
	\item The last example can be generalized to the category of $R$-modules, in which the free objects are (up to isomorphism) direct products of $R$'s.
\end{itemize}

\section{Groups}



\subsection*{\underline{Normal Subgroups}}

\subsection*{Conjugation}

\begin{definition*}
	Let $G$ be a group with $a, b, x \in G$. The \textbf{conjugate} of $a$ by $x$ is the element $^xa = xax^{-1}$. We say that $a$ and $b$ are conjugate if $^xa = b$ for some $x \in G$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	The relation $a \sim b$ if $a$ is conjugate to $b$ forms an equivalence relation. We call the equivalence class containing $a$ the \textbf{conjugacy class} of $a$, denoted $\bar{a}$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	The \textbf{automorphism group} of a group $G$, denoted $\Aut(G)$, is the set of all automorphisms of $G$. The set of all automorphisms which arise as conjugation by a fixed element form the \textbf{inner automorphism group} of $G$ and is denoted $\Inn(G)$.
\end{definition*}

\exc{Prove the map $\cdot \: G \times G \to G$ given by $g \cdot x = \null^xg$ defines a group action of $G$ on itself.}
\exc{Prove the map $\alpha_x(a) = \null^xa$ is an automorphism.}
\exc{Prove $\Inn(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $\Aut(G)$.}
\vskip20pt

\subsection*{Characteristic Subgroups}

\begin{definition*}
	The \textbf{center} of a group $G$, denoted $Z(G)$, is the set of all elements which commute with every element of $G$, i.e. $Z(G) = \{ z \in G \ | \ zg = gz, \forall g \in G\}$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	Given a subset $S$ of a group $G$, the \textbf{subgroup generated by $\boldsymbol{S}$} is the smallest subgroup containing $S$, equivalently, the intersection of all subgroups containing $S$. The \textbf{normal subgroup generated by $\boldsymbol{S}$} is the smallest normal subgroup containing $S$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	The \textbf{commutator subgroup} of a group $G$, denoted $G'$ or $[G, G]$, is the subgroup generated by all \textbf{simple commutators} in the group, i.e. the elements $[a, b] = aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ such that $a, b \in G$. A product of simple commutators is simply called a \textbf{commutator}.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	A subgroup $H < G$ is \textbf{characteristic} if $\alpha(H) = H$ for every automorphism $\alpha$ of $G$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	The quotient group $G/G'$ is called the \textbf{abelianization} of $G$.
\end{definition*}

\exc{Prove $[a,b]^{-1} = [b,a]$ and $\null^x[a, b] = [\null^xa, \null^x,b]$.}
\exc{Prove if $f\: G \to H$ is a homomorphism, then $f([a,b]) = [f(a), f(b)]$.}
\exc{Prove every characteristic subgroup is normal.}
\exc{Prove $G'$ and $Z(G)$ are characteristic, and therefore normal.}
\exc{Prove  $G/N$ is abelian if and only if $G' \subseteq N$.}
\vskip20pt 

\subsection*{Normalizer and Core}

\begin{definition*}
	The \textbf{normalizer} of a subgroup $H < G$ is a subgroup $N_G(H) = \{ g \in G \ | \ gHg^{-1} = H\}$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	The \textbf{core} of a subgroup $H < G$ is the set $\bigcap_{x \in G} xHx^{-1}$.
\end{definition*}

\exc{Prove every subgroup $H$ is normal in $N_G(H)$.}
\exc{Prove $H$ is normal if and only if $N_G(H) = G$.}
\exc{Prove the core of $H$ is the largest normal subgroup in $G$ contained in $H$.}

\clearpage



\subsection*{\underline{Simple Groups}}

\begin{definition*}
	A group is \textbf{simple} if it has no proper, nontrivial normal subgroups.
\end{definition*}

\begin{theorem*}
	\textnormal{(Abel's Theorem)} The alternating group $A_n$ is simple for all $n \neq 4$.
\end{theorem*}
\vskip20pt



\subsection*{\underline{Group Actions}}

\begin{definition*}
	A \textbf{group action} of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is a function $G \times X \to X$ denoted $(g, x) \mapsto g \cdot x$ such that for all $x \in X$ and $g_1, g_2 \in G$ we have
		\[ 1\cdot x = x, \hskip10pt \text{and} \hskip10pt (g_1g_2) \cdot x = g_1 \cdot (g_2 \cdot x). \]
	We then say that $G$ \textbf{acts on} $X$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	A \textbf{group action} of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is a homomorphism $\alpha\: G \to \Sym(X)$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	A group action $\alpha\: G \to \Sym(X)$ is \textbf{faithful} if it is injective.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	The \textbf{orbit} of an element $x \in X$ is the subset $Gx = \{ g \cdot x \ | \ g \in G\} \subset X$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	The \textbf{stabilizer} (\textbf{isotropy subgroup}) of $x \in X$ is a subgroup $G_x = \{ g \ | \ g \cdot x = x \} < G$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	If $G_x = G$ then the orbit $Gx$ is a \textbf{fixed point}; conversely if $G_x = \{1\}$ then $Gx$ is a \textbf{principal orbit}. The set of all fixed points is denoted $X^G$. If this set is trivial, the action is \textbf{fixed-point-free}. If all orbits are principal, the action is \textbf{free}.
\end{definition*}

\exc{Prove the above definitions of a group action are equivalent.}
\exc{Show orbits partition $X$ (i.e. $x \sim y$ iff $g \cdot x = y$ for some $g \in G$ is an equivalence).}
\exc{Show the stabilizer of a group is generally not normal.}
\exc{Prove stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are conjugate (i.e. $G_{g \cdot x} = \null^gG_x$).}
\exc{Prove free implies fixed-point-free, but the converse dose not generally hold.}

\begin{theorem*}
	\textnormal{(Orbit Stabilizer Theorem)} Given a group action of a group $G$ on a set  $X$, the cardinality of each orbit is the index of the corresponding stabilizer, i.e. $|Gx| = [G : G_x]$ for all $x \in X$.
\end{theorem*}

\begin{corollary*}
	\textnormal{(Class Equation)} For any group action of a finite group $G$ on a finite set $X$, we have
		\[ |X| = |X^G| + \sum [G:G_x], \]
	where the sum is taken over a choice of elements representing each distinct, nontrivial orbit.
\end{corollary*}

\subsection*{Examples of Group Actions}

The most important actions in Sylow Theory are of a group $G$ acting on some substructure of itself. In the following examples, let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup.

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=22.5pt]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item The \textit{action of $G$ on itself by translation} is defined by $g\cdot x = gx$. The action is faithful. The orbits are all principle, and the stabilizers are all trivial. The action is free, and therefore fixed-point-free. The class equation says nothing illuminating.
	\item The \textit{action of $G$ on itself by conjugation} is defined by $g \cdot x = gxg^{-1}$. The orbits are $Gx = \bar{x}$, and the stabilizers are $G_x = Z(x)$. The fixed points form the center $Z(G)$. By the OST \[ |\bar{x}| = |G : Z(x)| \implies |\bar{x}| \text{ divides } |G|. \] The class equation gives \[ |G| = |Z| + |G:Z_1| + |G:Z_2| + \dots \] where $Z_1, Z_2, \dots$ are the centralizers of each of the nontrivial conjugacy classes of $G$.
	\item The \textit{action of $G$ on $\Sub(G)$ by conjugation} is defined by $g \cdot H = gHg^{-1}$. The orbits are $GH = \bar{H}$, and the stabilizers are $G_H = N_G(H)$. The fixed points are normal subgroups. By the Orbit Stabilizer Theorem 
		\[ |\bar{H}| = |G : N_G(H)| \implies |\bar{H}| \text{ divides } |G|. \]
	\item The \textit{action of $K < G$ on the cosets $G/H$ by translation} is defined by $k \cdot gH = (kg)H$. Determine necessary and sufficient conditions for $gH$ to be a fixed-point under this action. What does this imply when $K = G$?
	If $K = G$, the kernel of this action is given by
		\[ \{g \in G | g(xH) = xH \text{ for all } x \in G \} = \bigcap_{x \in G} xHx^{-1} =: \core(H). \]
	The core is the largest normal subgroup of $G$ contained in $H$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem*}
	Let $G$ be a group of order $n$, and let $H$ be a subgroup of index $\ell$. If $\ell$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$, then $H \triangleleft G$. If $n$ does not divide $\ell!$, then $\{1\} \neq \core(H) \triangleleft G$.
\end{theorem*}

\vskip20pt



\subsection*{\underline{Sylow Theory}}

\begin{definition*}
	A group $G$ of order $p^m$ for some prime $p$ and some integer $m \geq 1$ is called a \textbf{$\boldsymbol{p}$-group}. A $p$-group which is a subgroup of a finite group $G$ is called a \textbf{$\boldsymbol{p}$-subgroup}; in particular, if the subgroup has order the largest power of $p$ that divides $|G|$, it is a \textbf{Sylow $\boldsymbol{p}$-subgroup}. If $p$ is a prime divisor of $|G| < \infty$, we denote the set of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ by $\Syl_p(G)$. In addition, we denote $n_p(G) = |\Syl_p(G)|$. 
\end{definition*}


\begin{theorem*}
	\textnormal{(Sylow Theorems)} For a finite group $G$ and a prime $p$,
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=24.5pt]\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
		\item[\textnormal{(I)}] $G$ has at least one Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ (i.e. $n_p \geq 1$);
		\item[\textnormal{(II)}] any two Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugate (i.e. $\Syl_p(G) = \bar{P}$);
		\item[\textnormal{(III)}] $n_p$ divides $|G|$ and $n_p \equiv_p 1$ (i.e. $n_p \mid \ell$ where $|G| = p^m\ell$ with $p \nmid \ell$).
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem*}

\begin{lemma*}
	If a finite $p$-group $P$ acts on a finite set $X$, then $|X| \equiv_p |X^P|$.
\end{lemma*} 

\begin{corollary*}
	\textnormal{(Burnside's Theorem)} Finite $p$-groups have nontrivial center.
\end{corollary*}

\begin{theorem*}
	\textnormal{(Cauchy's Theorem)} If a prime $p$ divides the order of a group, then the group contains an element of that order.
\end{theorem*}

\exc{Use Burnside's Theorem and the Correspondence Theorem to show (by induction) that any $p$-group of order $p^k$ contains subgroups of order $p^m$ for all $0 \leq m \leq k$.}

\vskip20pt



\subsection*{\underline{Application of Sylow Theorems}}

\begin{definition*}
	If $N$ and $Q$ are groups, a group $G$ satisfying 
		\[ 1 \to N \hookrightarrow G \to Q \to 1. \]
	line is called an \textbf{\textit{extension}} of $Q$ by $N$.
\end{definition*}

\exc{Two extensions $G$ and $G'$ of $Q$ by $N$ are \textbf{\textit{equivalent}} if there is a homomorphism $f\: G \to G'$ such that the diagram below commutes. Show such an $f$ is an isomorphism.}

\exc{Prove the following 6 propositions (proofs are provided if necessary):}
\vskip5pt

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]\setlength\itemsep{5pt}
\item[(1)] A finite abelian group $G$ is simple if and only if it has prime order. \\
\begin{proof}
	Suppose first that $G$ has prime order. Then the only subgroups are the trivial group and $G$, so $G$ is simple. For the sufficiency, suppose $|G| = pn$ for some integer $n \geq 1$. By Cauchy's Theorem, there is an element of order $p$. The subgroup generated by this element is nontrivial, proper, and normal (from $G$ abelian). Therefore, $G$ is not simple.
\end{proof}
\item[(2)] If $G $ is nonabelian of prime-power order, then $G$ is not simple. \\
\begin{proof}
	By Burnside's Theorem, the center is nontrivial. The center is also proper (since $G$ is nonabelian) and normal. Thus, $G$ is not simple.
\end{proof}
\item[(3)] If $G$ is nonabelian and $|G| = pq$ for primes $p$ and $q$, then $G$ is not simple. \\
\begin{proof}
	Without loss of generality, assume that $p < q$. Then by Sylow Theorem (III) we have $n_q|p$, meaning either $n_q$ is $1$ or $p$. However, $n_q \equiv 1 (\mod q)$, so only $n_q = 1$ is possible.
\end{proof}
\item[(4)] If $G$ is nonabelian and $|G| = p^2q$ for primes $p$ and $q$, then $G$ is not simple. \\
\begin{proof}
	Suppose first that $q < p$. Then by Sylow (III) we have $n_p|q$ and $n_p \equiv 1 (\mod p)$. The only possibility is $n_p = 1$, as desired.  Conversely, suppose that $p < q$. By Sylow (III) we have $n_q|p^2$. If $n_q = 1$, we are done. If $n_q = p$, then by Sylow (III) $q \equiv 1 (\mod p)$. So $q$ divides $p-1$, contradicting the assumption $p < q$. If $n_q = p^2$, then there are $p^2$-many subgroups of prime order $q$. Away from the identity, these subgroups are disjoint because the intersection of any pair of subgroups (itself a subgroup) has order which divides the order of either subgroup (which is prime). Furthermore, the nontrivial elements of these subgroups have order $q$ because $q$ is prime. Thus there are $p^2(q - 1)$ many elements of order $q$ in $G$, leaving only room for one Sylow $p$-subgroup, i.e. $n_p = 1$.
\end{proof}
\item[(5)] If $G$ is nonabelian and $|G| = pqr$ for primes $p$, $q$, and $r$, then $G$ is not simple. \\
\begin{proof}
	Without loss of generality, suppose $p < q < r$. We utilize the "counting elements" technique. Consider $n_r$, which is any of $1$, $p$, $q$, or $pq$. Since $n_r \equiv 1 (\mod r)$, either $n_r = 1$ or $n_r = pq$. If $n_r = 1$, we are done, so assume $n_r = pq$. As in (4.) above, there must be $pq(r-1)$ many elements of order $r$ in the group. Consider next $n_q$, which is any of $1$, $p$, $r$, or $pr$. Since $n_q \equiv 1 (\mod q)$, the case $n_q = p$ is omitted. If $n_q = 1$, we are done. So $n_q$ is either $pr$ or $r$. Assume first that $n_q = pr$. Then there are $pr(q-1)$ many elements of order $q$. In total, the group contains
		\[ pq(r-1) + pr(q-1) = pqr + (pqr - pr- pq) = pqr + p(qr - r - q) \]
	many elements of order $q$ or $r$, which exceeds the order of the group. So assume $n_q = r$. Then there are $r(q - 1)$ many elements of order $q$. Note that this is not sufficiently many to surpass the number of elements in the group, so consider $n_p$, which is any of $1$, $q$, $r$, or $qr$. If $n_p = 1$, we are done. In any of the remaining cases, $n_p \geq q$, so there are at least $q(p - 1)$ many elements of order $p$ in the group. In total, there are
	\begin{align*}
		pq(r - 1) + r(q - 1) + q(p - 1) &= pqr - pq + qr - r + pq - q \\
		&= pqr + qr - r - q
	\end{align*}
	many elements of order $p$, $q$, or $r$, which again exceeds the order of the group. We conclude that one of $n_p$, $n_q$, or $n_r$ must have been $1$, implying that $G$ is not simple.
\end{proof}
\item[(6)] If $|G| = n$ has nontrivial, prime divisor $p$ and $n \nmid n_p!$, then $G$ is not simple. \\
\begin{proof}
	Let $X = \Syl_p(G)$, and consider the kernel of the group action $\alpha\: G \to \Sym(X)$ given by conjugation of $X$ by $G$. We are done if $\ker(\alpha)$ is nontrivial and proper since the kernel is always normal. It cannot be trivial by the first isomorphism theorem. On the other hand, if it is all of $G$, then any $P \in X$ satisfies $gPg^{-1} = P$ for all $g \in G$. In particular, $P$ ensures $G$ is not simple.

\subsection*{\underline{Free Groups}}

\begin{definition*}
	Let $F$ be a group and $X$ a subset of $F$. We say $F$ is a \textbf{free group on $\boldsymbol{X}$} if every function $\varphi\: X \to G$ to a group $G$ extends uniquely to a homomorphism $\Phi \: F \to G$.
	\vskip10pt

			F \arrow[dr, dashed, "\Phi"] & \\ X \arrow[u, hook'] \arrow[r, "\varphi"'] & G
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	A group $F$ is \textbf{free} if it is free on some subset $X$, called a \textbf{basis} for $F$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{theorem*}
	Free groups exist.
\end{theorem*}
\begin{proof}
	Let $X$ be a set. Define $X^{-1} = \{x^{-1} \ | \ x \in X\}$, where the exponent is (for now) only symbolic. The elements of $X \sqcup X^{-1}$ are \textbf{\textit{letters}}. A \textbf{\textit{word}} $\omega$ on $X$ is a finite string of letters
		\[ \omega = x_1^{\varepsilon_1}x_2^{\varepsilon_2} \dots x_n^{\varepsilon_n}, \]
	where $x_i \in X$ and $\varepsilon_i = \pm 1$. The value $n \geq 0$ is called the \textbf{\textit{length of the word}}. The \textbf{\textit{empty word}} is the word with length 0. Let $\Omega(X)$ be the set of all words on $X$. We \textbf{\textit{multiply}} words by juxtaposition, and \textbf{\textit{invert}} by running backwards with inverse letters (i.e. exponent changes polarity). A \textbf{\textit{subword}} us a connected substring. We say a word is \textbf{\textit{reduced}} if it has no subwords $xx^{-1}$ or $x^{-1}x$ for some $x \in X$. Define an \textbf{\textit{elementary operation}} on a word $\omega$ by inserting/deleting a subword of the form $xx^{-1}$ or $x^{-1}x$ anywhere in $\omega$. Two words are \textbf{\textit{related}} if they differ by finitely many elementary operations. This defines an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\Omega(X)$. We define the set 
		\[ F(X) = \Omega(X)/\sim \] 
	and a multiplication of equivalence classes by $[\omega][\eta] = [\omega\eta]$. To see that this operation is well-defined, consider the following Lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma*}
	Every word $\omega$ is equivalent to a unique reduced word $\overline{\omega}$, and $\overline{\omega\eta} = \overline{\omega} \ \overline{\eta}$.
\end{lemma*}

\begin{theorem*}
	The set $F(X)$ defined above is free on $X$.
\end{theorem*}

	Every group $G$ is isomorphic to the quotient of a free group.
\end{theorem*}

\exc{Prove this by considering a generating set $X$ for $G$ along with its inclusion into $G$.}

\subsection*{\underline{Group Representations}}

\begin{definition*}
	A group is \textbf{finitely-generated} if there exists a finite set of generators.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	A group is \textbf{finitely presented} if there exists a finite generating set $X$ such that $F(X)/N \cong G$, where $N$ is normally generated by finitely many elements in $F(X)$. The elements of the generating set of $X$ are called \textbf{generators}, and those of $N$ are called \textbf{relations}.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	Suppose $G$ is finitely presented with generators $x_1, \dots, x_p$ relations $r_1, \dots, r_q$. We write
		\[ G = \langle x_1, \dots, x_p \ | \ r_1, \dots, r_q \rangle \]
	 meaning $G \cong (x_1, \dots, x_p) / \langle r_1, \dots, r_q \rangle$, and call this a (finite) \textbf{presentation} of $G$.
\end{definition*}

There are oftentimes many ways of presenting a group, which can lead to confusion. In addition, we might want to claim that a given representation is a recognizable group. The following theorems help simplify these issues (the latter is not super useful in practice).

\begin{theorem*}
	\textnormal{(van Dyck's Theorem)} If $G = \langle x_1, x_2, \dots | r_1, r_2, \dots \rangle$ and $H$ is a group with generators $y_1, y_2, \dots$ such that $r_i(y_1, y_2, \dots) = 1 \in H$, there exists an epimorphism $G \twoheadrightarrow H$ with $f(x_i) = y_i$. 
\end{theorem*}

\begin{tikzcd}
	B \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[dr] & F \arrow[r] \arrow[d, dashed] & F/R \arrow[dl, dashed, "f"] \\
	 & H & 
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

\begin{theorem*}
	\textnormal{(Tietze's Theorem)} If $G$ has two different finite presentations $\langle x_1, \dots, x_p \ | r_1, \dots, r_q \rangle$ and $\langle y_1, \dots, y_m \ | \ s_1, \dots, s_n \rangle$, then one can pass from one to the other by \textbf{elementary Tietze operations}: add/remove generator; add/remove relation which are consequence of remaining ones.
\end{theorem*}

\exc{Show that  $G = \langle x, y \ | x^4 = 1, x^2 = y^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \rangle$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$ (Hint: Use van Dyck's Theorem, and prove the group has order $8$ by arguing each element can be written $a^nb^m$ for restricted values of $m, n$).}

\subsection*{\underline{Miscellany}}

\begin{lemma*}
	\textnormal{(Product Recognition)} If $H, K \triangleleft G$ with $H \cap K = \{1\}$ and $HK = G$, then $G \cong H \times K$.
\end{lemma*}

\begin{proposition*}
	If $S, T < G$, then $ST < G$ if and only if $ST = TS$ setwise. Moreover, if $S$ and $T$ are normal, then $ST$ is normal, as well.
\end{proposition*}

\begin{proposition*}
	If $S, T < G$ and $ST < G$, then $\displaystyle |ST| = |S||T|/|S \cap T|$.
\end{proposition*}

\section{Rings}

\begin{definition*}
		If $I, J < R$, the sets $I + J$ and $I J$ are defined by
		\begin{align*}
			I + J &= \{ a + b \ | \ a \in I, b \in J \} \\
			IJ &= \{a_1b_1 + \dots + a_nb_n \ | \ a_i \in A, b_i \in B, n \in \N \}.
		\end{align*}
\end{definition*}

\begin{proposition*}
	If $I, J < R$, then the sets $I \cap J$, $I + J$, and $I J$ are also ideals in $R$. Moreover,
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=22.5pt]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
		\item[\textnormal{(a)}] $I + J$ is the smallest ideal containing both $I$ and $J$;
		\item[\textnormal{(b)}]  $IJ \subset I \cap J$, and if $R = I + J$ is commutative with identity, $IJ = I \cap J$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{proposition*}

For rings $S < R$ with $A \subset R \setminus S$, recall that $S[A]$ is the smallest ring containing the subset $S \cup A \subset R$. Similarly, $S(A)$ denotes the smallest field containing this subset. As we are "adding" the elements $A$ to $S$, we often refer to $S(A)$ as the ring $S$ \textit{adjoin} the set $A$. One can show that $R[u]$ is isomorphic to $R[x]$, the polynomial ring over $R$; similarly, $R(u)$ is isomorphic to $R(x)$, the field of rational polynomials over $R$.

\section{Fields}

\begin{definition*}
	 Let $L$ be a field with $K \subseteq L$ a subfield. We call $L$ a \textbf{field extension} of $K$, written $L/K$. For $u \in L \setminus K$, the field extension $K(u)/K$ is called a \textbf{simple extension} of $K$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	Given a field extension $L/K$, we can consider $L$ as a $K$-vector space; the dimension of this vector space is called the \textbf{degree} of the field extension and is denoted $\d LK$. According to the cardinality of this number, we say the extension of $L$ over $K$ is (in)finite.
\end{definition*}

\noindent \textbf{Properties}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item the degree of an extension $L/K$ is $1$ if and only if $L = K$;
	\item given fields $K \subset L \subset M$, we have $\d MK = \d ML \d LK$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition*}
	Let $L/K$ be a field extension. An element in $L \setminus K$ is \textbf{algebraic} over $K$ if it is a zero of some nonzero polynomial in $K[x]$; otherwise, it is \textbf{transcendental}. A simple extension $K(u)$ is an \textbf{algebraic extension} if $u$ is algebraic over $K$; otherwise it is a \textbf{transcendental extension}.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	A field $F$ is \textbf{algebraically closed} if 
\end{definition*}

\begin{theorem*}
	Let $L/K$ be a field extension and $u \in L$. Then:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12.5pt]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
		\item if $u$ is transcendental over $K$, then $K[u] \cong K[x]$ and $K(u) \cong K(x)$;
		\item if $u$ is algebraic over $K$, then there exists a unique, monic, irreducible polynomial $m_u \in K[x]$ such that each $f \in K[x]$ with $f(u) = 0$ is a multiple of $m_u$ and $K[u] \cong K(u)$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem*}

\begin{corollary*}
	Transcendental extensions are infinite; finite extensions are algebraic.
\end{corollary*}

\begin{definition*}
	Let $M$ and $L$ be fields containing a field $K$. Then $LM = L(M) = M(L)$ is a field extension over $K$ and $L$ and $M$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{theorem*}
	Consider extensions $ML/K$, $M/K$, and $L/K$ having degrees $n$, $m$, and $\ell$.

	Then $n \leq m \ell$, or equivalently $s \leq \ell$, or equivalently $r \leq m$.
\end{theorem*}
\vskip40pt



\begin{definition*}
	For a field extension $M/K$, the \textbf{Galois group} of $N$ over $K$ is the group  $\Gal MK$ of automorphisms that leave every element of $K$ fixed. The \textbf{fixer} of an intermediate field $L$ is the set $L' \subseteq G$ of automorphisms in $\Gal MK$ which fix $L$ pointwise. Conversely, the \textbf{fixed field} of the subgroup $H < G$ is the subset $H' \subset M$ of elements fixed by each element in $H$.

\begin{definition*}
	The \textbf{closure} of an intermediate object is its double prime. An intermediate object is \textbf{closed} if it is equivalent to its closure. We say $M$ is \textbf{normal} over $K$ if $\Gal MK' = K$.
\end{definition*}

\noindent \textbf{Properties}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item let $L$ and $M$ be intermediate fields of $N/K$ with $\d ML = n$, then $\d{L'}{M'} \leq n$;

	\item all finite subgroups of $G$ are closed;
	\item if $M$ is normal over $K$, then $M$ is normal over any intermediate field $L$ with $\d LK$ finite.
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem*}
	\textnormal{(Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory)} Let $M$ be a normal, finite-dimensional extension of $K$, and let $G = \Gal MK$. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of $G$ and the intermediate fields of $M$ and $K$, implemented by the priming operation. Moreover, the relative degrees are preserved, and in particular, $\d MK = |G|$.

\begin{theorem*}
	Given a finite group $G$ of automorphisms of a field $M$, the field extension of $M$ over the fixed field of $G$ is normal, finite-dimensional, and has Galois group $G$.
\end{theorem*}
\vskip40pt

\begin{definition*}
	For fields $K \subset M \subset L$, we say that $L$ is \textbf{stable} relative to $K$ and $M$ if every automorphism of $M / K$ sends $L$ into (and consequently onto) itself.
\end{definition*}

\noindent \textbf{Properties}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item stable intermediate fields correspond to normal subgroups;
	\item the closure of a normal subgroup is normal; the closure of a stable intermediate field is stable;
	\item if $M$ is normal over $K$ and $L$ is stable relative to $K$ and $M$, then $L$ is normal over $K$;
	\item if $M$ is normal over $K$ and $f \in K[x]$ is irreducible with root $u \in M$, then $f$ factors over $M$ into distinct linear factors;
	\item if $L$ is normal and algebraic over $K$, then $L$ is stable (relative to any extension $M \supset L$);
	\item if $L$ is a stable intermediate field of $M/K$, then $G/L'$ is isomorphic to the group of all automorphisms of $L/K$ that are extendible to $M$, where $G = \Gal MK$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem*}
	(\textnormal{Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, cont'd}) In the correspondence, a field $L$ is normal over $K$ if and only if the corresponding subgroup is normal in $G = \Gal MK$, and in this case, $G/H$ is the Galois group of $L/K$.

\begin{definition*}
	Let $f \in K[x]$. We say that $M$ is a \textbf{splitting field} of $f$ over $K$ if $f$ factors completely in $M$ and $M = K(u_1, \dots, u_n)$, where $u$'s are the roots of $f$. We say $M$ is a splitting field over $K$ if there exists a polynomial $f$ for which $M$ is a splitting field of $f$ over $K$.

An element $u$ that is algebraic over $K$ is said to be \textbf{separable} over $K$ if its irreducible polynomial is separable over $K$.

\section{Modules}

\subsection*{\underline{Basics}}

\begin{definition*}
	An $R$-module $M$ is a vector space whose scalars have been replaced by a ring $R$.
\end{definition*}

\exc{A module is \textbf{\textit{simple}} if its only submodules are $M$ and $\{0\}$. Classify the simple $\Z$-submodules.}

\begin{definition*}
	An \textbf{$\boldsymbol{R}$-linear map} or \textbf{$\boldsymbol{R}$-module homomorphism} is a function $f\: M \to N$ satisfying $f(rm + n) = rf(m) + f(n)$ for every $m, n \in M$ and $r \in R$. The set of all $R$-linear maps from $M$ to $N$ is denoted $\Hom_R MN$; in the case $M = N$, we write $\End_R M$ for endomorphism.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	The \textbf{quotient $\boldsymbol{R}$-module} of an $R$-module $M$ by a submodule $N$ is the module of cosets of $N$ in $M$ under the operations
		\[ (a + N) + (b + N) = (a + b) + N \text{ and } r(a + N) = ra + N, \]
	for all $a, b \in M$ and $r \in R$.

\exc{Show the analogous isomorphism theorems hold for quotients of $R$ modules.}

\begin{definition*}
	The \textbf{direct sum} of $R$-modules $M$ and $N$ is the module $M \oplus N = \{(m, n) | m \in M, n \in N\}$ with pointwise operations. We often write $M^n = M \oplus \dots \oplus M$ for $n$-many copies of $M$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	An element $m$ of an $R$-module $M$ is \textbf{torsion} if there exists a nonzero $r \in R$ such that $rm = 0$. An $R$-module $M$ is a \textbf{torsion module} if each of its elements are torsion.

	For a subset $S$ of an $R$-module $M$, the \textbf{submodule $\boldsymbol{\langle S \rangle}$ generated by $\boldsymbol{S}$} is the smallest submodule of $M$ containing $S$ (equivalently, the intersection of all submodules containing $S$), or constructively
		\[ \langle S \rangle = \Big\{ \sum r_is_i \ \Big| \ r_i \in R, s_i \in S \Big\}. \]
	If $S = \{s\}$, then $M = \langle s \rangle$ is a \textbf{cyclic $\boldsymbol{R}$-module}. If $S$ is a finite set, then $M$ is \textbf{finitely generated}.

\subsection*{\underline{Modules over a PID}}

\begin{theorem*}
	\textnormal{(Invariant Structure Theorem)} If $R$ is a PID and $M$ is a finitely-generated $R$-module, then there is a unique nonnegative integer $r$ and a unique sequence $J_i < R$ of nested, nonzero proper ideals such that
		\[ M \cong R/J_1 \oplus \dots \oplus R/J_k \oplus R^r. \]
	The integer $r$ is called the \textbf{rank} of $M$, and the ideals are called the \textbf{invariant factors} of $M$.
\end{theorem*}

\begin{theorem*}
	\textnormal{(Primary Structure Theorem)} If $R$ is a PID and $M$ is a finitely-generated $R$-module, then there exist finitely many prime elements $p_i \in F[t]$ and nonzero integers $n_i$ such that
		\[ M \cong R/ \langle p_1^{n_1} \rangle \oplus \dots \oplus R/ \langle p_k^{n_k} \rangle. \]
	The prime elements $p^n$ are called the \textbf{elementary divisors} of $M$.

\subsection*{\underline{The Vector Transformation Module}}
\begin{definition*}
	Let $V$ be an $F$-vector space, and let $T\: V \to V$ an endomorphism. We define $\boldsymbol{V_T}$ to be the $F[t]$-module whose additive structure is inherited from $V$, and whose ring is $F[t]$, where scalar multiplication is given by $f(t) \cdot v = f(T)v$. 
\end{definition*}

\noindent \textbf{Properties}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item if $V$ is finite dimensional, then $V_T$ is torsion -- since $\End(V) \cong M_n(F)$ is $n^2$ dimensional, there are $a_i \in F$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{n^2} a_iT^i = 0$;
	\item by the Invariant Structure Theorem, $V_T \cong F[t]/ \langle f_1 \rangle \oplus \dots \oplus F[t]/ \langle f_k \rangle$;
	\item in this module, we reconstruct $T$ as multiplication by the scalar $f(t) = t$, acting in each summand (i.e. $Tv = t \cdot v$) -- to understand $T$, we can understand this multiplication;
	\item for $f = \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} a_it^i$, the module $F[t]/ \langle f \rangle$ has basis $B = \{ \bar 1, \bar t, \bar t^2, \dots, \bar t^n\}$, so multiplication by $\bar t$ can be represented by the \textbf{companion matrix}
		\[ C_f = \begin{pmatrix} 
			0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -a_0 \\
			1 & 0 &\cdots & 0 & -a_1 \\
			0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 & -a_2 \\
			\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots  \\
			0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & -a_n \\
		\end{pmatrix}. \]
	\item carrying the basis $B$ to $V_T$ by the isomorphism given above, it follows that there is a basis $C$ for $V$ such that $T_C = C_{f_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus C_{f_k}$, where $\oplus$ denotes the block sum of matrices.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition*}
	A matrix is said to be in \textbf{rational canonical form} if it can be written as $C_{f_1} \oplus \dots \oplus C_{f_k}$ for monic polynomials $f_1, \dots, f_k$ with $f_1 | \dots | f_k$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{corollary*}
	Every $T \in \End_F(V)$ has a coordinate matrix in rational canonical form, uniquely determined by $T$ and $F$, which we denote by $R_T$ (or $R_{T/F}$ to denote over which field).
\end{corollary*}

\begin{corollary*}
	If $F$ is a field, any $A \in M_n(F)$ is similar over $F$ to a unique matrix $R_A$ (i.e. there is an invertible $P \in M_n(F)$ such that $PAP^{-1} = R_A$). It follows that two matrices are similar if and only if they have the same Rational Canonical Form.
\end{corollary*}

\begin{definition*}
	Note that $\{ f \in F[t] : f(T) = 0 \}$ is an ideal of $F[t]$, which is a PID. The unique, monic generator $m_T(t)$ is called the \textbf{minimal polynomial} of $T$.
\end{definition*}

\noindent \textbf{Properties}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item $m_T(T) = 0$ (just a nice reminder);
	\item the minimal polynomial is the larges (last) invariant factor of $T$;
	\item the characteristic polynomial $c_T$ is equal to the product of the invariant factors of $T$;
	\item (Cayley-Hamilton) $m_T$ divides $c_T$ and the roots of $c_T$ are roots of $m_T$;
\end{itemize}

\begin{corollary*}
	If $F \subseteq E$ are fields, then two matrices $A, B \in M_n(F)$ are similar over $F$ if and only if they are similar over $E$.
\end{corollary*}

\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
	The multiplication of $(t - \lambda)^n$ by $t$ can be written as an $n \times n$ matrix $J_{\lambda, n}$ called a \textbf{\textit{Jordan block}}. Any matrix which is a block sum of Jordan blocks is in \textbf{\textit{Jordan Canonical Form}}. Therefore, by the Structure Theorem (Primary Form):
\end{definition*}

\begin{corollary*}
	Every $T \in \End_F(V)$ whose characteristic polynomial factors into linear terms is similar over $F$ to a matrix $J_T$ in Jordan canonical form (unique up to permutation of blocks). The total number of appearances of each eigenvalue $\lambda$ is its multiplicity in $c_T$, and the size of the largest associated Jordan block is the multiplicity of $\lambda$ as a root of $m_T$.
