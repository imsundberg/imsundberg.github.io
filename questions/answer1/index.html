	<p>Firstly, let's remind ourselves of what a binary algebra structure is: a binary algebra structure is a pair \$(S, \star)\$
	consisting of a set \$ S \$ and a binary operation \$ \star \$ on that set.</p>
	
	<p></p>Although it is easy to come up with a set and binary operation which do not produce a binary algebra structure (any binary
	operation which is not closed on the set, e.g. \$ \mathds{Z}^* \$) it is less easy to produce a binary structure which is 
	not a group.</p>
