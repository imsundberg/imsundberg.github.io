  I am currently a graduate student at Bryn Mawr College studying mathematics. My researh interests are in low-dimentional topology. Outside of research, I have a strong interest in math history and math education. I hope to make this site a helpful resource for both myself and others by compiling interesting mathematical information from around the web.
