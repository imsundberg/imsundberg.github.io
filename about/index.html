  I am currently a graduate student at Bryn Mawr College studying mathematics. Although I haven't selected an area of research, my interests tend in the topological direction. Outside of research, I have a strong interest in math history and math education. I hope to make this site a helpful resource for both myself and others by compiling interesting mathematical information from around the web.
