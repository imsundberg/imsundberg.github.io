  I am currently a graduate student at Bryn Mawr College studying mathematics. Although I haven't selected a topic yet, my research interests tend in the topological direction. Outside of research, I have a strong interest in math history and college-level math education. Besides using this site as a reference for contact, I hope this site becomes helpful resource for both myself and others by compiling interesting mathematical information from around the web. Hobbies include: long walks on the beach, romantic candlelit dinners, and frisbee.
