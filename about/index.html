	<p>I am currently a graduate student of mathematics at Bryn Mawr College in Philedalphia, PA. Prior to moving to Pennsylvania, I 
	received my	B.A. of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse. I was born and raised in the La Crosse area and am very fond
	of the Driftless region to which it belongs.</p>
	
	<p>Other than mathematics I enjoy coffee, cooking, music, running, and math.</p>
