  I am currently a PhD candidate and TA in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College, however my mathematics career began in La Crosse, WI. After dreaming of being a classical pianist throughout my teenage years, I decided to do persue something with a "safer job market". My first math class at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse (UWL) was Calc I, which I almost failed. It was a beautiful class, presented by a careful yet energetic professor, and it convinced me to keep taking math classes. After (briefly) considering applied math, I settled on a theoretical math courseplan. I was very fortunate to find a phenominal support system of professors at UWL, not only helping me with mathematics, but with the academic scene in general. 
  
  After two years of coursework, I passed my preliminary exams (fall 2018), and am now focused on my research in low-dimensional topology. During this time I also received my master's degree (spring 2018); my thesis was an exposition of Stallings' Fibering Theorem, advised by <a href="http://www.brynmawr.edu/math/people/melvin/">Paul Melvin</a>.
