				The Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) is a biweekly meeting for graduate students to share mathematics with their peers in a comfortable environment. The seminar meets on Mondays from 11am-12pm in Park 328. Snacks and refreshments are available at 10:45, and the seminar begins at 11.<br><br>

				The goal of the GRS is to provide a supportive space for graduate students to practice giving talks. As the focus is on quality, there is no required topic, and the speaker determines the length of the talk. Students are encouraged to use this space to:
				<ul>
					<li>present research, expository work, or coursework</li>
    			<li>share material from workshops/conferences attended</li>
					<li>practice upcoming talks</li>
    			<li>obtain feedback from peers</li>
				</ul>
				Please <a href="mailto:icraig@brynmawr.edu">contact the organizers</a> if you would like more information.
