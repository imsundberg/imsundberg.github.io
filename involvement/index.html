				The <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/gsas/gsa-executive-board">Graduate Student Association</a> (GSA) is a graduate student run organization at Bryn Mawr College with the purpose of disseminating relevant information and concerns between the college and graduate student body.

				Together with Audrey Wallace (Classics), I served on the college's Graduate Council. There, we advocated for the creation of a Parental Leave Policy to ensure that all graduate students anticipating the birth or adoption of a child are guaranteed continued funding and health care for an extended period of time. The <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/sites/default/files/GSAS%20Parental%20Leave%20Policy%20-%20FINAL%20(1).pdf">policy we authored</a> was implemented in 2018 and covers graduate students for a minimum of 8 weeks.

				<h3>Directed Reading Program</h3>

				The Directed Reading Program (DRP) is an initiative that matches undergraduate students with graduate student mentors to work on independent study projects. The pair work together to read through a mathematical resource (e.g. part of a book or paper). At the end of the semester, the mentee prepares a presentation, given at the DRP Symposium. A DRP project provides undergraduates with the opportunity to develop independent learning skills, improve communication and presentation skills, experience working one-on-one with a mentor, explore topics that are not part of the standard curriculum, and prepare for research experiences while in a low-pressure environment. Any student interested in learning a mathematical topic outside of their current coursework can work on a DRP project, no background prerequisite.

				I co-founded and co-organized the DRP at Bryn Mawr College with Aisha Mechery in the fall of 2019. The program included four research pairs, covering topics such as hyperbolic geometry, the Riemann zeta function, linear algebra, and geometric group theory.
