				 The Graduate Council at Bryn Mawr College is an elected group of professors and students representing all departments within the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) at Bryn Mawr College. This group meets monthly to address concerns within the GSAS by enacting policy changes.

				I served on Graduate Council as an elected representative from the GSA. While on graduate council, I served on two work groups to make policy changes adressing concernes of graduate students:
				<ul>
					<li>Together with Audrey Wallace (Classics), I advocated for the creation of a Parental Leave Policy to ensure that all graduate students anticipating the birth or adoption of a child are guaranteed continued funding and health care for an extended period of time. The <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/sites/default/files/GSAS%20Parental%20Leave%20Policy%20-%20FINAL%20(1).pdf">policy we authored</a> was implemented in 2018 and covers graduate students for a minimum of 8 weeks.</li>
					<li>Together with Clare Rasmussen (Archaeology), I advocated for the implementation of a diversity statement in the graduate application process at Bryn Mawr College. Our work group was terminated between meetings of the Graduate Council.</li>

				The Directed Reading Program (DRP) is an initiative that matches undergraduate students with graduate student mentors to work on independent study projects. The pair work together to read through a mathematical resource (e.g. part of a book or paper). At the end of the semester, the mentee prepares a presentation, given at the DRP Symposium. A DRP project provides undergraduates with the opportunity to develop independent learning skills, improve communication and presentation skills, experience working one-on-one with a mentor, explore topics that are not part of the standard curriculum, and prepare for research experiences while in a low-pressure environment. Any student interested in learning a mathematical topic outside of their current coursework can work on a DRP project, no background prerequisite.

				I co-founded and co-organized the DRP at Bryn Mawr College with Aisha Mechery in the fall of 2019. The program included four research pairs, covering topics such as hyperbolic geometry, the Riemann zeta function, linear algebra, and geometric group theory.
