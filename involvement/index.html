<b>Graduate Student Association (GSA): 2016-2020</b>

<div id="pad">The GSA is a graduate student run organization with the purpose of disseminating relevant information and concerns between the college and graduate student body.</div>

<div id="pad">Together with Elena Gittleman, I served as the co-chair of the GSA throughout the academic years 2017-2019.</div>

<div id="pad">My most proud contribution to the college was the result of a collaboration with Audrey Wallace, with whom I served on the college's Graduate Council. Together, we advocated for the creation of a Parental Leave Policy to ensure that all graduate students anticipating the birth or adoption of a child are guaranteed continued funding and health care for an extended period of time. The inclusive policy we authored was implemented in 2018 and covers graduate students for 8 weeks.</div>
