<b>Graduate Student Association (2016-2020)</b>

<div id="pad">The Graduate Student Association (GSA) is a graduate student run organization at Bryn Mawr College with the purpose of disseminating relevant information and concerns between the college and graduate student body.</div>

<div id="pad">Together with Elena Gittleman, I served as the co-chair of the GSA throughout the academic years 2017-2019.</div>

<div id="pad">My most proud contribution to the college was the result of a collaboration with Audrey Wallace, with whom I served on the college's Graduate Council. Together, we advocated for the creation of a Parental Leave Policy to ensure that all graduate students anticipating the birth or adoption of a child are guaranteed continued funding and health care for an extended period of time. The inclusive <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/sites/default/files/GSAS%20Parental%20Leave%20Policy%20-%20FINAL%20(1).pdf">policy we authored</a> was implemented in 2018 and covers graduate students for 8 weeks.</div>

<b>Graduate Research Seminar (2019-2020)</b>

<div id="pad">The Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) is a biweekly seminar at Bryn Mawr College that is organized by graduate students, for graduate students.</div>

<div id="pad">I co-founded the seminar with my peer Lindsay Dever in 2019 with the purpose of giving graduate students the opportunity to present research in a comfortable, unsupervised environment. We are funded by Bryn Mawr's graduate student chapter of the American Mathematical Society.</div>

<div id="pad">I organized the seminar in 2019.</div>
