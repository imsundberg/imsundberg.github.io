				The <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/gsas/gsa-executive-board">Graduate Student Association</a> (GSA) is a graduate student run organization at Bryn Mawr College with the purpose of disseminating relevant information and concerns between the college and graduate student body.

				Together with Audrey Wallace (Classics), I served on the college's Graduate Council. There, we advocated for the creation of a Parental Leave Policy to ensure that all graduate students anticipating the birth or adoption of a child are guaranteed continued funding and health care for an extended period of time. The <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/sites/default/files/GSAS%20Parental%20Leave%20Policy%20-%20FINAL%20(1).pdf">policy we authored</a> was implemented in 2018 and covers graduate students for a minimum of 8 weeks.

				The Directed Reading Program (DRP) is an initiative that matches undergraduate students with graduate student mentors to work on independent study projects. The pair work together to read through a mathematical resource (e.g. part of a book or paper). At the end of the semester, the mentee prepares a presentation, given at the DRP Symposium. A DRP project provides undergraduates with the opportunity to develop independent learning skills, improve communication and presentation skills, experience working one-on-one with a mentor, explore topics that are not part of the standard curriculum, and prepare for research experiences while in a low-pressure environment. Any student interested in learning a mathematical topic outside of their current coursework can work on a DRP project, no background prerequisite.
