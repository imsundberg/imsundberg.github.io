<b>Graduate Student Association (2016-2020)</b>

<div id="space">The <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/gsas/gsa-executive-board">Graduate Student Association</a> (GSA) is a graduate student run organization at Bryn Mawr College with the purpose of disseminating relevant information and concerns between the college and graduate student body.</div>

<div id="space">Together with Elena Gittleman, I served as the co-chair of the GSA throughout the academic years 2017-2019.</div>

<div id="space">My most proud contribution to the college was the result of a collaboration with Audrey Wallace, with whom I served on the college's Graduate Council. Together, we advocated for the creation of a Parental Leave Policy to ensure that all graduate students anticipating the birth or adoption of a child are guaranteed continued funding and health care for an extended period of time. The <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/sites/default/files/GSAS%20Parental%20Leave%20Policy%20-%20FINAL%20(1).pdf">inclusive policy we authored</a> was implemented in 2018 and covers graduate students for a minimum of 8 weeks.</div>

<div id="space">I served one final year on the GSA as the Department Representative from math.</div>
